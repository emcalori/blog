## Hello again üòé

I've recently started following the CS50 course hosted by Harvard through the edX platform. As someone who has no formal computer science training, I'm hoping this will be a good place to start to fill in any of the gaps I've missed going directly into software engineering. 

It starts fairly slowly in lecture 0, introducing some of the very basics of computational thinking. Think binary notation, RGB colours and introductions into ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) - which maps specific letters to numbers to allow electronic communication. I'd never really looked at this before, so I'm thinking I might take some more time in the future to learn about it more fully. 

The main portion of the lecture was focussed on introducing Scratch - a high level programming language focussed on a visual approach to learning, where blocks of codes are represented as lego like building blocks. Although it's obvious that this is primarily an educational tool aimed at children, it was still quite interesting to approach coding in such an interactive way. Although I probably won't be investing too much time into Scratch, it was fun to create a simple pong style game and think about different coding concepts such as loops and conditionals in a different way. Onto the next lecture!
